# ci-docker-images
This repository contains the source for the Docker images used in [makedeb](/makedeb/makedeb)'s CI pipelines.

The images are built on top of the normal [makedeb Docker images](https://docs.makedeb.org/home/installing/docker/), with added dependencies needed in makedeb CI pipelines. Images are automatically built and republished nightly.
